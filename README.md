# odin-substrings
The project implements the substrings method that takes a string, and a dictionary of valid substrings.
The substrings method returns a hash listing each substring found in the original string and the match count
It demonstrates the basic ruby knowledge I learned on The Odin Project.
The project consists of a main ruby file with a ruby test file.

The knowledge applied to this project are as follows:
1. Ruby:
    - Basic data types
    - Variables
    - Input and output
    - Conditional logic
    - Loops
    - Arrays and hashes
    - Methods
    - Debugging
